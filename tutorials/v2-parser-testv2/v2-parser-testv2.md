## Intro

It's now time to switch to SAP HANA as a database and prepare your project for an MTA deployment to SAP BTP Cloud Foundry. To continue with this tutorial you need to [Use an existing SAP HANA Cloud service instance](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/btp-app-hana-cloud-setup.html#42a0e8d7-8593-48f1-9a0e-67ef7ee4df18) or [set up a new SAP HANA Cloud service instance](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/btp-app-hana-cloud-setup.html#3b20e31c-e9eb-44f7-98ed-ceabfd9e586e) to deploy your CAP application.

> Your SAP HANA Cloud service instance will be automatically stopped overnight, according to the server region time zone. That means you need to restart your instance every day, before you start working with your trial.
